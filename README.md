Track your habits with a simple desktop application. 

There are two types of habits: binary and benchmark.

Binary habits are either completed or incompleted (nothing in between can be reached).

Benchmark habits are measurable (a decimal value like $15.5$ can be interpreted as $15.5$ minutes or $15.5$ bottles or $15.5$ calories) and compared to a "benchmark", a minimum value for the habit to be considered complete.

This project was inspired by *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. Visual statistics in the form of a plot/graph help you track your progress/stay satisfied.
